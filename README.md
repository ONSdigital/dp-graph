dp-graph
================

A library to abstract graph database logic away from services

### Configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Description
| -------------------- | ------- | -----------
| GRAPH_DRIVER_TYPE    |   ""    |  string identifier for the implementation to be used (e.g. 'neo4j' or 'mock')
| GRAPH_ADDR           |   ""    |  address of the database matching the chosen driver type
| GRAPH_POOL_SIZE      |   0     |  desired size of the connection pool
| MAX_RETRIES          |   0     |  maximum number of attempts for transient query failures
| QUERY_TIMEOUT        |   0     |  maximum number of seconds to allow a query before timing out

All config other than `GRAPH_DRIVER_TYPE` will be subject to that implementation to make use of
and set reasonable defaults for use in that context. It's feasible that some implementations
might not have configurable timeouts for example, so whether this can be set should be
documented in each driver.
